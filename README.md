Group 1
A Perfect Storm? Wildfires in the US

Are weather patterns and human activity correlated to forest fires in the US?
    How do natural and manmade factors interact to influence forest fires?
    Can we predict where wildfires will start and factors that help propagate them     
(topography etc)?

Rationale: Forest fires and wildfires have become a frequent part in our daily lives causing devastating losses to life, property and habitat. Recent examples include the California and Australia wildfires of 2019. 

What could we do to predict fires thus preventing loss of life and property?

Data Needs/Sources include: Weather data (rainfall, humidity, lightning strikes, wind), forest density, topography data, US Forest/Park Service (campfires), Google Maps(proximity to water, road density, etc.), Census data (population density), US Core Science for Geography (topography/hydrography)

First step in analysis:
    Explore data to determine time frame of analysis (expected to be 1992 to 
2015)
    Begin to map State/US wildfire data to obtain locations of interest and begin to     plot     
collect longitudinal data about those points
 Plot average temperature and # of wildfires to determine correlation
